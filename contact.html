        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy
         text of the printing and
         typesetting industry. Lorem
         Ipsum has been the industry's
         standard dummy text ever since
          the 1500s, when an unknown
          printer took a galley of type
          and scrambled it to make a
          type specimen book. It has
          survived not only five centuries,
          but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially
           unchanged. It was popularised in
           the 1960s with the release of
           Letraset sheets containing Lorem
           Ipsum passages, and more recently
           with desktop publishing software
           like Aldus PageMaker including
           versions of Lorem Ipsum.
